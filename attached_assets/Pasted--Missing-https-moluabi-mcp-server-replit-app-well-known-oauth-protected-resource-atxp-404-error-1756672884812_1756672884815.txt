 Missing: https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/atxp (404 error)

This is the next step in the ATXP authentication flow. The ATXP SDK needs OAuth resource server metadata to know how to authenticate with the MCP server.

Let me test if this endpoint exists:


Executed curl -s https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/atxp

Executed curl -s https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
Perfect! We're making excellent progress. Here's the updated status:

MCP Handshake Progress ‚úÖ
‚úÖ initialize method: Working perfectly!
‚úÖ notifications/initialized method: Now working! (no error = success)

New Issue: OAuth Resource Metadata
‚ùå Missing OAuth endpoint: /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/atxp returns 404

The ATXP SDK is now successfully completing the MCP handshake, but it needs OAuth resource server metadata to handle ATXP authentication.

What to tell the MCP server team:
Fantastic progress! Both MCP handshake methods are now working! üéâüéâ

However, we need one more endpoint for full ATXP integration:

Missing OAuth Metadata Endpoint: /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/atxp

Current Error: 404 - "Cannot GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/atxp"

What this should return: OAuth resource server metadata that tells the ATXP SDK how to authenticate. This is a standard OAuth discovery endpoint.

Example Response Structure:

{
  "issuer": "https://auth.atxp.ai",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://auth.atxp.ai/oauth/authorize", 
  "token_endpoint": "https://auth.atxp.ai/oauth/token",
  "resource": "https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/atxp"
}
This endpoint enables the ATXP SDK to discover how to authenticate with your server for payment processing.

Current Status:

‚úÖ MCP handshake (initialize + notifications/initialized)
‚ùå OAuth resource metadata discovery
Once this endpoint is added, ATXP integration should be fully functional!
We're very close to having full ATXP integration working! üöÄ
