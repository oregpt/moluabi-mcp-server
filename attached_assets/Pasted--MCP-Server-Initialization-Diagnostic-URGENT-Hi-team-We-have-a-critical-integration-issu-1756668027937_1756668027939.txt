# MCP Server Initialization Diagnostic - URGENT

Hi team,

We have a **critical integration issue** with our MCP server and ATXP SDK. A user has provided detailed diagnostics showing that while our free tier works perfectly, the ATXP integration is failing due to missing MCP protocol methods.

## Current Issue Summary

**What's Working ✅**
- Free tier mode: Direct HTTP calls to `/mcp/call` work perfectly
- All tools execute successfully (list_agents, create_agent, prompt_agent, etc.)
- API authentication works correctly
- Server returns proper JSON responses

**What's Failing ❌**
- ATXP SDK cannot establish connection to our server
- **Critical Error:** `"Method not found: initialize"` when SDK tries to connect
- ATXP endpoint at `/atxp` doesn't support MCP lifecycle methods

## Technical Details from User Testing

The user tested both endpoints:

**✅ This works (free tier):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/mcp/call \
-d '{"name":"list_agents","arguments":{"apiKey":"mab_..."}}'
# Returns: agents list successfully
```

**❌ This fails (ATXP endpoint):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/atxp \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{},"id":1}'
# Returns: {"error":{"code":-32601,"message":"Method not found: initialize"}}
```

**Key Finding:** Our `/atxp` endpoint accepts `tools/call` but **NOT** `initialize`

## Critical Issue: Missing MCP Protocol Methods

**The ATXP SDK Flow:**
1. SDK connects to `https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/atxp`
2. Sends JSON-RPC initialize request: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{...},"id":0}`
3. **Our server responds:** `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32601,"message":"Method not found: initialize"},"id":0}`
4. SDK fails and cannot proceed to tool calls

**Question 1:** Why does our `/atxp` endpoint not support the `initialize` method?
- Does our `/atxp` endpoint implement full MCP protocol or just tool calls?
- Is there a difference in how we handle `/mcp/call` vs `/atxp` endpoints?
- **Critical:** The ATXP SDK expects full MCP JSON-RPC protocol before making any tool calls

## Endpoint Architecture Investigation

**Question 2:** Please map out our current endpoint structure:
- **`/mcp/call`** - What does this endpoint do? (Works perfectly with direct calls)
- **`/atxp`** - What does this endpoint do? (Accepts `tools/call` but not `initialize`)
- Are these two separate implementations or should they be unified?

**Question 3:** MCP Protocol Compliance per Endpoint:
- Does `/mcp/call` support full MCP JSON-RPC protocol?
- Does `/atxp` support full MCP JSON-RPC protocol?
- **Key Finding:** `/atxp` accepts `tools/call` but rejects `initialize` - this suggests partial MCP implementation

## Required MCP Methods for ATXP Integration

**Question 4:** Based on user testing, our `/atxp` endpoint needs to support these JSON-RPC methods:

**Missing (Critical):**
- [ ] `initialize` - **FAILING** with "Method not found" error
- [ ] `list_tools` - SDK needs to discover available tools  
- [ ] `list_resources` - If we have any resources
- [ ] `list_prompts` - If we have any prompts

**Partially Working:**
- [?] `tools/call` - User confirms this method exists but requires ATXP auth

**Question 5:** Do we properly implement session management?
- Do we generate and return a session ID in the `Mcp-Session-Id` HTTP header during initialization?
- Do we validate this session ID on subsequent requests?
- Do we return a 404 when a session expires to trigger re-initialization?

**If missing:** Implement session tracking using an in-memory store (Map/object) that associates session IDs with client connections.

## Transport Configuration

**Question 6:** What transport method does our `/atxp` endpoint use?
- The user is making HTTP POST requests to `/atxp`
- ATXP SDK expects Streamable HTTP transport
- **Verify:** Is our `/atxp` endpoint properly configured for Streamable HTTP MCP transport?

## Authentication Layer Analysis

**Question 7:** Authentication behavior differences:
- **Free tier (`/mcp/call`):** Works with API key in request body
- **ATXP endpoint (`/atxp`):** Returns "Payment required - ATXP authentication missing"
- **Critical:** How should ATXP authentication integrate with MCP protocol initialization?

## Core MCP Protocol Implementation

**Question 8:** Based on the user's error, please verify we implement these methods **specifically on the `/atxp` endpoint**:
- [ ] `initialize` - **CRITICAL:** Currently returns -32601 "Method not found" 
- [ ] `list_tools` - Required for ATXP SDK to discover our tools
- [ ] `list_resources` - Return available resources (if we have any)
- [ ] `list_prompts` - Return available prompts (if we have any)
- [ ] `tools/call` - User confirmed this exists but needs ATXP auth
- [ ] `read_resource` - Serve resource content (if applicable)

## Server Metadata and Capabilities

**Question 9:** For the `/atxp` endpoint, do we return proper initialization response?
When `initialize` is called, we should return:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "name": "moluabi-mcp-server",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "capabilities": {
      "tools": {
        "list_tools": true
      },
      "resources": {},
      "prompts": {}
    }
  },
  "id": 0
}
```

**Instead we're returning:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32601,"message":"Method not found: initialize"},"id":0}
```

## Immediate Testing Requirements

**Question 10:** Can you test these specific curl commands on our server?

**Test 1 - Initialize (Currently Failing):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/atxp \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{},"id":1}'
```
**Expected:** Success response with server capabilities  
**Current:** `{"error":{"code":-32601,"message":"Method not found: initialize"}}`

**Test 2 - List Tools (Unknown Status):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/atxp \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"list_tools","params":{},"id":2}'
```

**Test 3 - Tool Call (Partially Working):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/atxp \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_agents","arguments":{"apiKey":"mab_..."}},"id":3}'
```
**Expected:** Tool execution  
**Current:** "Payment required - ATXP authentication missing" (shows method exists)

## Root Cause Analysis Questions

**Question 11:** Implementation Architecture:
- Are we using the official MCP SDK for the `/atxp` endpoint?
- Did we implement `/atxp` as a custom API that only partially follows MCP protocol?
- **Critical:** Why does `/mcp/call` work but `/atxp` missing `initialize`?

**Question 12:** Integration Pattern:
- Is `/atxp` supposed to be a full MCP server or just a tool execution endpoint?
- Should we unify both endpoints to use the same MCP implementation?
- Can we make `/atxp` inherit all MCP protocol methods from `/mcp/call`?

## Immediate Action Items

**Priority 1 (Blocking ATXP Integration):**
1. **Fix `/atxp` endpoint** to respond to `initialize` method
2. **Add `list_tools`** method to `/atxp` endpoint  
3. **Test with provided curl commands** to verify MCP protocol compliance

**Priority 2 (Validation):**
4. Run MCP Inspector against `/atxp` endpoint
5. Verify session management works with ATXP authentication
6. Document the difference between `/mcp/call` and `/atxp` endpoints

## Testing Validation

After implementing fixes, please test:
```bash
# Should work after fix:
curl -X POST https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/atxp \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{},"id":1}'

# Should return our tools:
curl -X POST https://moluabi-mcp-server.replit.app/atxp \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"list_tools","params":{},"id":2}'
```

**Bottom Line:** The ATXP SDK expects full MCP JSON-RPC protocol compliance on the `/atxp` endpoint, but we're only implementing `tools/call`. We need to add the missing MCP lifecycle methods (`initialize`, `list_tools`, etc.) to make ATXP integration work.

Please let me know your findings for each question, and we can troubleshoot any missing pieces together.

Thanks!
